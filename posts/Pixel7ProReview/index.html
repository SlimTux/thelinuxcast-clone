        <h1>Google Pixel 7 Pro Review</h1>


        <p>I have been on a bit of an adventure when it comes to my mobile phone. For the last year, I've been on the
            Galaxy S22+, which I purchased used off of Amazon (or refurbished). It served me well, but as the year went
            on, the battery life got progressively worse. So bad, in fact, that it would only last about 2 hours on a
            charge.</p>
        <p>So, I decided that I need to upgrade. Yes, I could have paid for a battery replacement, and I still might do
            so (I still have it), but I like new stuff, so I decided that I'd get a new phone. For the last few years, I
            have prided myself on always buying used or refurbished devices. It makes me feel a bit better about e-waste
            and such. This time, I splurged and decided to buy new.</p>
        <p>My first attempt at this was the OnePlus 10 Pro. That device ended up being so buggy that I had to send it
            back. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't deal with the bugs and the slow software updates to the US were a
            definite problem.</p>
        <p>So, I sent that back and pondered for a while. I thought about going back to the iPhone but I really have
            lost all taste for iOS, so that was a no-go. I then decided that I'd go with a Pixel after talking about it
            with friends on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@@SlimTux">Mastodon</a>. I've never had a Pixel before,
            always being scared off by their constant hardware and software issues in past generations. But this
            generation seemed to be mostly free of that nonsense (This was before I found out that the camera lens was
            spontaneously exploding), so I decided to give it a go.</p>
        <p>I bought the Pixel 7 Pro because I love big-screen phones, and I've been using it for the last several weeks.
            Here is my brief review.</p>
        <h1>Hardware</h1>
        <p>The hardware on the Pixel is not for everyone, that's for sure. I hated it last year, which is why I didn't
            get it when I decided to go back to Android and chose the Galaxy S22+. I honestly wasn't sure that I'd like
            it any better this year, but I changed my mind. Most phones are getting taller and taller and staying the
            same width. I don't mind taller phones, but I also want something that feels wider in my hand. The Pixel 7
            Pro does this, and I'm very happy about it. It feels like it fits my man hands, and it's the first Android
            phone that has ever done so.</p>
        <p>The cameras are awesome, but I'm not a pixel peeper, so I had no problems with the cameras on my phone four
            or five years ago. Are they better than that, yes. But I don't really notice all that much. I know the
            photography nerds out there are shouting at me, but I'm not one of you. I just don't have an interest in it,
            I'm afraid.</p>
        <p>The screen is big and bright and the refresh rate is nice (though I did end up turning it back down to 60hz,
            which I'll talk about later). It is slightly curved along the sides, which bugs the crap out of me. Not that
            it doesn't look great, but the accidental touches are something that phone manufacturers haven't ever really
            figured out. I still end up having it accidentally thinking I'm touching the screen when I'm just scrolling
            along. It's annoying but doesn't happen so often that it's unbearable.</p>
        <p>The under-screen fingerprint sensor is fast and mostly responsive, though it does have a problem with my
            right thumb despite me reteaching it several times (the S22+ had the same problem, so I think my thumb is
            the issue). The rest of my figures that I've trained work fine.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest issues I have with the hardware is that the volume and power buttons are really, really
            low on the side, and I always press the power button when I meant to go to the volume button. That's
            annoying and could have been solved if someone had actually tested the device beforehand. Why phone
            manufacturers have to have the volume buttons and the power button on the same side is beyond me. There's a
            whole other side there and it feels lonely. Do better Google.</p>
        <p>The last thing I should talk about is battery life. It's horrible. I mean like really bad. Not as bad as the
            Samsung I just left, but for a new device, it's really disappointing. I can get through 4PM on a single
            charge before I have to put it on the charger. That's not okay. I always have around six to ten more hours
            of my day before I can go to sleep, so a second charge is probably always going to be the case, but I'd
            expect a little more than what I've gotten so far.</p>
        <p>So I turned off the high refresh rate. I thought that would help, but it honestly made no difference so I
            turned it back on. I also tried to use the device at 1080p instead of 1440p, but that made everything so big
            on the screen that it was basically unusable. So, what I ended up doing was getting a case that has a
            MagSafe-like magnet on the back and a MagSafe charger. I now can charge the phone while I'm at my desk. Not
            what I want to do, but works okay.</p>
        <h1>Software</h1>
        <p>There is always a lot of talk about &quot;Stock Android&quot; and how close the Pixel is to that ideal. I've
            always wondered what the big deal was because honestly, I loved OneUI. The transparency and the great work
            Samsung has done in making it easy to use huge phones with one hand were really appreciated and made the
            S22+ a pleasure to use. I could have done without all the un-uninstallable bloatware, but whatever.</p>
        <p>The software on the Pixel 7 Pro is fine. It has some things I like, and some things I think are butt ugly.
            Let's start off with the things I like.</p>
        <h2>Material You</h2>
        <p>I like the adaptive color scheme. I know it's not a favorite of everyone, but having the colors change when I
            change the wallpaper, is nice. I wish it did a better job of actually choosing colors that are a part of the
            wallpaper, but for the most part, it's still pleasing. I also like that more and more apps are taking this
            on, so it feels more like the entire ecosystem is changing a bit whenever I change my wall.</p>
        <h2>Multitasking View</h2>
        <p>This is nice. Google has added several awesome features to the multitasking view that make it more useful.
            You can copy text right from that view, take a screenshot without going into an app, copy images, and so on.
            It's very nice.</p>
        <h2>Quick Settings Menu</h2>
        <p>It's not as good as Samsung's but it works fine and I like the design of it for the most part. I do think the
            buttons are too big here, they could have more settings on the first pull-down if the buttons weren't so
            big.</p>
        <p>Now let's talk about the rest and the things I don't like.</p>
        <h2>Lack of Transparency</h2>
        <p>I know this isn't a huge deal, but coming from the S22+, where transparency is all over the place, the lack
            of any transparency at all in the notification shade and elsewhere was really jarring. It makes it feel so
            outdated and kind of fugly, IMO. It just looks so much better on the S22+ that I almost sent the Pixel back.
            It just looks so bad.</p>
        <p>The big buttons are also very odd. As I mentioned before, it'd help in the quick settings menu if the buttons
            were smaller. You'd get more settings on a page, which means that you could get to your quick setting much
            faster.</p>
        <h2>Screen Touch Sensitivity</h2>
        <p>I'm putting this here because I think it's a software problem, but it could be hardware related, I don't
            know. Basically, when you do any swiping on the screen, it takes such an exaggerated motion to get the phone
            to actually follow through with it. I don't know how better to explain it other than sometimes when you
            swipe left or right, it won't actually follow through with the motion. It's very odd. It does have something
            to do with the haptic feedback because if you turn that off, the problem goes away. Hopefully, they fix
            that.</p>
        <h1>Software Updates</h1>
        <p>This is one area that I'm really excited about. Every other Android is so far behind what Google offers in
            terms of Android versions and it takes them so long to catch up. It's ridiculous. I love that I'll get the
            new stuff from Google on Day 1. It also comes with the risk of bugs, but I think that will be okay. I'll see
            if I still feel that way in a year.</p>
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>I love this phone. I don't care for the software as much as I thought I would, but the hardware is so good
            and feels so nice in the hand that I can overlook my dislike of the look and feel of the software. Add on
            that I found that MagSafe is awesome and works great on an Android with a MagSafe case, and I'm finding that
            the Pixel is still my favorite phone that I've had in many years. If they can make the software even just a
            little better, I'd be so much happier.</p>
