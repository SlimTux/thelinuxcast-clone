<h1>Goals For 2023</h1>


<p>Happy New Year.</p>
<p>I know it has been a while since my last blog post, so sorry about that, but the holidays and RL were happening, so it just kind of fell by the wayside. Blogging weekly is something I hope to get back into this year.</p>
<p>I hope everyone had a great holiday season. Mine was quite good. Spent a lot of time with family, which makes all the headaches worth it for sure.</p>
<p>Now that we're entering a new year, I wanted to spend some time thinking about my goals professionally and personally and for YouTube. I separate out YouTube because it's still a hobby but it also feels like a job since I make some money doing it. It's kind of an odd place to be in, but it works out okay. Today I want to talk a bit about my goals for the channel this year.</p>
<h1>A Video A Day Keeps the Algorithm Happy</h1>
<p>My plan for this year is ambitious: one video every single day of the year. I've had a good streak going like this once before (right when I started the channel) but it fell by the wayside. It took a long time for me to be okay with taking days off, but eventually, I realized that the channel would still be here if I took a day off.</p>
<p>But I like doing videos every day, so I'm going to give that a try. To do it, I'll need to get ahead, because I will still want some days off. My goal is to get significantly ahead over the next month so that I can always have videos on deck even if I don't feel like recording a new one.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is that I'm awful at getting ahead. I've tried so many times, and I'll get ahead for a few days, and then I'll just stop making videos and the cache will go away. That's going to be something to avoid this time if I want to do this. I guess we'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>My next goal is to start to change my content just a bit. I do too many frilly, no-substance, videos. I like my rants and such, and those won't go away, but I want to do some more stuff with substance. Tutorials, in-depth guides, maybe a few interviews, self-hosting stuff, and a little more on security and privacy, things like that. I'm also going to be learning Python this year, so maybe I'll do some programming videos as I progress, I don't know. I just know that I need to broaden my horizons a lot since some of my content lately has felt like reruns to me. I can bitch about RTFM-bros and how much I like #Fedora only so often before it just gets stale.</p>
<p>Next, I want to blog more, so expect that to happen. I'm planning on at least once a week, but more likely I'll do two a week. Patrons will get all of these early. I will likely blog about many topics, not just Linux, but some general tech stuff too, so that should be fun.</p>
<p>I'm also going to be doing a weekly Patron/Supporter-only podcast starting this week. It will be just a few minutes of me talking about something that interested me or caught my eye. The first episode of that should be out on Wednesday or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm going to be starting up my weekly live streams again. Probably Sundays around 8PM ET. The first one I think will be tonight, so that should be fun. I do need to think about topics for those, though, because I can't just rice every single stream. As much as I really want to, of course.</p>
<p>I hope that 2023 finds all of you well. I don't say it here often enough, but I thank each and every one of you for your support this last year and going forward. It truly means the world to me, and I can't thank you enough. As I say at the end of every video, you guys are awesome.</p>
<p>Hope you have a safe and happy New Year,</p>
<p>Matt</p>
