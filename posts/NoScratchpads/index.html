        <h1>Missing Scratchpads</h1>


        <p>So as I've been talking about both in the Patron Exclusive Pod (available to all tiers) and on the channel,
            I've switched to XFCE. My plan is still to be on XFCE for 2 months (As I write this, I'm only a week in).
        </p>
        <p>I do miss my window managers, that's for sure. I'm going to be itching to go back once this experiment is
            over, I have a feeling.</p>
        <p>But there is one thing that I miss more than any other and that is scratchpads. Now, I do have a dropdown
            terminal (I use Tilix, and that has a quake mode, which is pretty nice), but it's just not the same.</p>
        <p>When I'm on i3wm or whatever, I always have about six scratchpads that I open up many times a day. I have
            newsboat there, I have pulsemixer, I have ncmpcpp or whatever it's called, I have ranger, and couple extra
            empty terminals. All of them are available via a separate keybinding for ready and easy use. It's awesome.
        </p>
        <p>On XFCE, none of that is here. Not that's not possible, because I'm sure that with some effort I could
            replicate that functionality (in fact, I'm sure I could, and I may do), but it's just something that isn't
            default or something that I think most people would even consider unless they've used a window manager
            before.</p>
        <p>And that brings me to Workspaces. I mentioned this on my patron-only pod, but I don't use workspaces nearly
            as much on XFCE as I did when in a window manager. One of the reasons why is that windows pile up and don't
            tile by default. So I don't have to deal with smaller and smaller windows, and can just leave a whole pile
            of them on one workspace and alt-tab to the one I need. Another reason why is the absolutely crap way XFCE
            (and other DEs) handle workspaces with multiple monitors. They treat both monitors as a single workspace, so
            when you change workspaces, both monitors change. You can't get them to be independent. It just feels
            inefficient and against everything I know and love when it comes to workspaces.</p>
        <p>Honestly, the mess of it all is driving me batty. Right now as I look at it, I have seven windows on my
            second monitor, all piled on top of one another. I can only see the top two. It feels so...trashy. And
            completely inefficient. Obviously, this is not an XFCE problem, but it is a DE problem, and it's a big one.
            The workflow here is just anathema to the way I have worked for the majority of the last three years.</p>
        <p>So, those are the two big problems. Scratchpads are probably something I will solve on my own because I do
            miss them enough that spending the time to figure all that out makes sense. The workspace thing is something
            that will continue to just drive me nuts until I eventually say eff it and either install i3 and use it with
            XFCE or I abandon XFCE completely. Who knows which way that will go.</p>
        <p>I hope everyone has a nice week. If you're reading this on the website, you can get all of my blog posts
