<h1>Lacking Ideas</h1>


<p>I don't know if you guys have noticed or not, but sometimes the videos that come out on the channel are a bit lackluster. I do try to come up with and produce good content.</p>
<p>But nobody can create good content all the time. Sometimes there are stinkers.</p>
<p>I'll admit that the absolute hardest part of doing this is the ideas behind the content. Coming up with new ideas, especially when you put out as many videos as I do, is really effin' hard. So, yeah, there are quite a few videos that are on topics that just kind of flop.</p>
<p>It doesn't bother me as much as it used to. In the early days, when I put out a stinker, I'd be a bit depressed about it. Unhappy that no one wanted to watch it. Angry sometimes too, because sometimes the stinkers weren't throw away videos, but were instead videos that I had put quite a bit of effort into.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I don't care as much. I know now, from experience, that sometimes videos flop. I've even gotten pretty good at recognizing when a video is unlikely to do well. Either it's a topic that just won't appeal to many or I've done it too often. Because I have gotten a little repetitive. I've noticed in some of my more noob-friendly videos that I've been repeating myself a bit too much.</p>
<p>It is something I need to improve on. And I have started to think about doing some more app and distro based videos. Maybe a few more tutorials. Fewer rants (don't worry those won't ever go away entirely), things like that.</p>
<p>Another problem is that because I've done so many videos (Over 500 so far), I've forgotten which one's I've done in the past. So I've found myself a couple times redoing videos I've already actually posted. So that's another thing that I'm going to have to keep track of, or at least do a better job of keeping track of.</p>
<p>Anyways, I guess the point this week is that I'm sometimes out of ideas, that's why you'll see the occasional stinker on the channel.</p>
<p>Hope everyone has a great week. If you're reading this on the website, all my blog post are released a week early for patrons. Check that out <a href="https://patreon.com/thelinuxcast">here</a>.</p>
