        <h1>I&#39;m an Influencer. What Now?</h1>


        <p>I have been a member of Twitter since 2009. I will be completely honest and say for the first, oh, I don't
            know, 5 years or so, I was mostly the type of Twitter user who posted things like &quot;I'm home&quot; and
            &quot;Here's my dinner&quot;.</p>
        <p>Very exciting stuff, let me tell you.</p>
        <p>But even then, I had high aspirations. As anyone can attest who was around in those early days of social
            media, it was a common dream to have a large following of people who waited with bated breaths for your next
            amazing post. I don't really know how I was expecting to get that type of following with the type of inane
            content I was posting, but I still had those dreams. And it wasn't just Twitter. I used every social
            platform at the time in pretty much the same way. (The only exception, kinda, being Facebook, where I had
            been since 2004. At the time, that was still more about family connections than anything else).</p>
        <p>Obviously, fame and social standing never happened for me on my @mtwb twitter account. (still inordinately
            proud of having a four letter handle). The most followers I ever achieved was around 1,000, and that was
            only because I joined up with a political follow-back thing that encouraged all of their memebers to follow
            each other back. I eventually stopped the political thing and unfollowed everyone I had followed, which, of
            course, led to my follower count going way down.</p>
        <p>Even now, no my main, personal account on Twitter, I have only around 900 followers, the vast majority of
            whom are probably bots. Every once in a while I'll get a post that gets 10 or 12 likes, but that is pretty
            rare. I do have a few people on that account that I interact with, but mostly I use it for following my
            fanfiction peeps and a few friends from school.</p>
        <p>In 2017, I created The Chad's Cast. Ricky, on of my online friends, and I decided to create the Linux podcast
            so we could nerd out together about Linux. We carried on for almost a year or so. I created <a
                href="https://twitter.com/@SlimTux">@@SlimTux</a> then. I think I had about 20 followers for the
            entire first two years of the pod.</p>
        <p>After those two years, the Linux pod laid dormant. Ricky and I got busy with other things, and while I still
            used Linux full time, Ricky will always been an Apple fanboy. In 2020, when I went to Anchor (where I host
            both of my podcasts), I noticed that people were actually listening to those old episodes of The Chad's
            Cast. That spurred me to start back up.</p>
        <p>The success of the YouTube channel has been phenomenal. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't shake my
            head at the success that I've had. I mean, I'm not DT or Chris Titus, but 20k is a ton of people. 20,000
            people have subscribed to my channel. Just thinking about it makes me a bit dizzy, tbh.</p>
        <p>The thing that came with that YouTube success, however, is the thing that back in 2009, I wanted the most:
            Twitter fame. Okay, maybe not fame, but I now have 1500 followers on Twitter (not even a ton more than I've
            had on my main account for years), but the difference is that I have true interaction on @@SlimTux more
            than I ever did on my personal account. People like and retweet and reply on my Tweets a ton. Just this
            morning I woke up and had over 100 mentions, some of them from actual, big time Linux YouTubers, as they
            were discussing a Tweet I made about AppImages.</p>
        <p>It feels so odd, whether it is on Twitter or YouTube or on Discord, for people to actually <em>care</em> what
            I have to say. I'm just a nerd from the mid-west, playing on his computer all damn day. That 'fame' I wanted
            in 2009, now that it's here ish, seems so odd. If anyone called me an influencer, I'd probably cuss them
            out, but this must be a tiny bit what those actual people with influence feel like every day, just on a far
            grander scale. I can't imagine having 100,000 followers on Twitter. Or a million. That'd be crazy and I have
            no clue how I'd handle that. As is, it feels surreal, I can't imagine what more would feel like.</p>
        <p>I find that the bigger I get on social media, the more I strive to not care how big I get on social media. No
            longer do I want internet fame. Don't get me wrong, I love that people subscribe to my channel, and I want
            them to continue doing so, but I no longer just want to be popular for popularity's sake. I want to be known
            for a good reason. I want people to follow or subscribe because I helped them or they find my stuff
            interesting. Just getting a ton of subscribers/followers for the sake of being influential, just kind of
            makes me sick and ashamed of my younger self who very much wanted that. Now, as I gain followers for a good
            reason, I think that's a much better way to go about it.</p>
        <p>And to go back to the not caring bit, I also find that it's a mental health thing too. Even when I first
            started off with YouTubing (not a word), I was obsessed with getting more and more subs. Now, I still check
            my subscriber count a few times a day (mostly I just see it passing by as I go towards the content view of
            YouTube studio), but I no longer have to check it 10 times an hour to see if I got one more subscriber. It's
            made the whole thing a lot more fun for me. I can make my videos and tweet my tweets, without doing it for
            what seem like the wrong reasons. And as I continue to do that, I think my videos will keep getting better.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, those are some brief thoughts on my Social Media journey. I hope everyone has a great week. If
